#  EmployeeDirectoryApp

## Build tools & versions used
No specific build tools apart from XCode itself. Version is set at 1.0

## Steps to run the app
No dependencies , so no need to worry about pod dependencies, u can directly run it on Xcode. 

## What areas of the app did you focus on?
I have covered as many aspects as I can and focussed mostly on having seperate services, components and protocol oriented. Reasonalble test cases are added to avoid redundancy. 

## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?
Focus is to make sure that the list loading is as seamless and smooth as possible.

## How long did you spend on this project?
I have spent around 5-6 hours on the project seperated over several days.  

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?
I would have written more tests for all services and made custom alert, spinners and polish UI more. Also getting a crop ratio or image size from the server would enormously help with the list images for automatic sizing. 

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
Maybe the UI which is very simple, although I do not see it as a weakness. I wish we can get the crop ratio for images so i can dynamically calculate the cell sizes to fit all images 

## Did you copy any code or dependencies? Please make sure to attribute them here!
  Used apple documentation, stackoverflow and articles on medium and better programming to get good references and solve bugs - no bulk copying.

## Is there any other information youâ€™d like us to know?
Unit tests are covered for networking, viewmodel and tableview aspects. No UI tests implemented

Thank you very much for your time.
